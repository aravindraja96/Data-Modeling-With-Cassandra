## Introduction
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

## Project Description
As a data engineer , I have created an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions. Database can be tested by running queries given by the analytics team from Sparkify to create the results.
